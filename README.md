## Projects
### Project 1: Prescriptive Analytics for Formula One Racing Data
â€¢	Developing a regression model to predict the qualifying time in Formula One racing using historical data from the sport. 
â€¢	Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering the data to prepare it for modeling. 
â€¢	Using techniques such as Random Forest, gradient boosting, and LSTM to create the predictive model based on qualifying_time. 
â€¢	Performing Prescriptive Analytics (Sensitivity Analysis) to identify the features that most have the chance to impact the output and remodeling based on that.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
Implemented sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Built a web application to visualize the sentiment trends.


## Experience
### Data Analyst â€“ AI (INTERN)
#### Mytectra
â€¢	As part of a team of 5 analysts, I demonstrated my flexibility and innovation by identifying, analyzing, and interpreting trends and patterns in complex datasets, developing a new algorithm that improved response accuracy by 20%. My contribution to the algorithm development process saved the team 5 hours of manual work per week.
â€¢	In addition to my analytical work, I showed my energy and enthusiasm by streamlining our data entry process, reducing errors by 25%. I also created detailed statistics to compare the new and old models, leading to a 10% improvement in efficiency.
â€¢	Through my work in filtering correlations and visualizing observations, I used my innovative approach to identify key insights that informed our strategy and led to a 15% increase in client satisfaction.

### Data Analyst â€“ PowerBI (INTERN)
#### Vistas Foundation 
â€¢ Collaborated with a team of data analysts to leverage Power-BI for data visualization and reporting purposes, contributing to the organization's data-driven decision-making processes. 
â€¢ Developed interactive dashboards and reports using Power-BI, enabling stakeholders to easily access and analyze key performance indicators, resulting in improved visibility and informed decision-making. 
â€¢ Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and modeling tasks to ensure data accuracy and consistency, enhancing the quality and reliability of the reports generated
