## Projects
### Project 1: Prescriptive Analytics for Formula One Racing Data
-	Developing a regression model to predict the qualifying time in Formula One racing using historical data from the sport. 
-	Cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering the data to prepare it for modeling. 
-	Using techniques such as Random Forest, gradient boosting, and LSTM to create the predictive model based on qualifying_time. 
-	Performing Prescriptive Analytics (Sensitivity Analysis) to identify the features that most have the chance to impact the output and remodeling based on that.

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected tweets to remove noise, such as URLs, hashtags, mentions, and special characters. This step may also include tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stopwords.
Feature extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical or categorical features that can be used as input for machine learning models. Common feature extraction techniques for sentiment analysis include bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec).
- Labeling: Prepare a labeled dataset where each tweet is manually annotated with its corresponding sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral). This labeled dataset will serve as the ground truth for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
- Model training: Use the labeled dataset to train a sentiment analysis model. machine learning algorithms used for sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and more advanced techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Experience
### Data Analyst â€“ AI (INTERN)
#### Mytectra
-	As part of a team of 5 analysts, I demonstrated my flexibility and innovation by identifying, analyzing, and interpreting trends and patterns in complex datasets, developing a new algorithm that improved response accuracy by 20%. My contribution to the algorithm development process saved the team 5 hours of manual work per week.
-	In addition to my analytical work, I showed my energy and enthusiasm by streamlining our data entry process, reducing errors by 25%. I also created detailed statistics to compare the new and old models, leading to a 10% improvement in efficiency.
-	Through my work in filtering correlations and visualizing observations, I used my innovative approach to identify key insights that informed our strategy and led to a 15% increase in client satisfaction.

### Data Analyst â€“ PowerBI (INTERN)
#### Vistas Foundation 
- Collaborated with a team of data analysts to leverage Power-BI for data visualization and reporting purposes, contributing to the organization's data-driven decision-making processes. 
- Developed interactive dashboards and reports using Power-BI, enabling stakeholders to easily access and analyze key performance indicators, resulting in improved visibility and informed decision-making. 
- Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and modeling tasks to ensure data accuracy and consistency, enhancing the quality and reliability of the reports generated
